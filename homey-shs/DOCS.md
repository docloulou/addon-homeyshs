# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Homey Self-Hosted Server

This add-on allows you to run [Homey Self-Hosted Server](https://homey.app) within your Home Assistant OS installation, providing a self-hosted alternative to the cloud-based Homey hub.

Homey Self-Hosted Server is a software-only product based on the operating system powering [Homey Pro](https://homey.app/homey-pro/). You host Homey Self-Hosted Server yourself, on your own hardware. You'll need to install and maintain it to keep it online and up to date.

Out of the box, it supports devices that connect over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Cloud, and Matter. Matter-over-Thread also works if you already have a Thread Border Router in your home. To add Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth LE, 433 MHz, or Infrared devices, simply connect a [Homey Bridge](https://homey.app/homey-bridge/) to unlock those wireless technologies — no USB sticks required.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

2. Select **Add a new Homey**
3. Choose **Self-Hosted Server**
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Currently, this add-on does not require any additional configuration. The add-on uses host networking mode by default, which means Homey Self-Hosted Server will be accessible on your local network. The server should automatically be discoverable by the Homey mobile app.

The add-on persists its data automatically in the `/data` directory.

### Technical Details

- **Docker Image**: `ghcr.io/athombv/homey-shs:latest`
- **Network Mode**: Host networking (required for device discovery)
- **Privileged Mode**: Enabled (required for hardware access)
- **Data Directory**: `/data` (persisted automatically)

### Ports

Homey Self-Hosted Server uses the following ports by default:
- HTTP: 4899
- HTTPS: 4868
- Bridge V1: 4861
- Bridge V2: 4842

Since the add-on uses host networking, these ports are directly accessible on your local network.

## Licensing

Every new installation of Homey Self-Hosted Server includes a 30-day free trial, with no payment details required.

After the trial, you can continue using Homey Self-Hosted Server by subscribing monthly or purchasing a lifetime license — helping support the ongoing development of Homey.

Self-Hosted Servers and licenses can be managed at the [My Self-Hosted Servers](https://homey.app/account/self-hosted-servers/) page on the Homey website.

### Monthly Subscription

Once you've set up your Homey Self-Hosted Server, you can start a monthly subscription from the [My Self-Hosted Servers](https://homey.app/account/self-hosted-servers/) page.

**Important**: If your monthly subscription expires, your Homey Self-Hosted Server will automatically go offline until you resubscribe or purchase a lifetime license.

### Lifetime License

Once you've set up your Homey Self-Hosted Server, you can buy a lifetime license from the [My Self-Hosted Servers](https://homey.app/account/self-hosted-servers/) page.

You can transfer your lifetime license between installations from the self-hosted servers management page.
