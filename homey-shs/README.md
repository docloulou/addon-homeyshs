Run Homey Self-Hosted Server as a Home Assistant add-on.

## ℹ️ Fork Information

**This fork allows SSH access to your data.**

Unlike the original add-on which stores data in the internal `/data` volume, this version persists data in `/addon_configs` (mapped to `/config` internally). This makes your Homey user data accessible via the standard **Terminal & SSH** add-on in Home Assistant, enabling easier manual backups and file access.


## About

This add-on allows you to run [Homey Self-Hosted Server](https://homey.app) within your Home Assistant OS installation.

Homey Self-Hosted Server is a software-only product based on the operating system powering [Homey Pro](https://homey.app/homey-pro/).

Out of the box, it supports devices that connect over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Cloud, and Matter. Matter-over-Thread also works if you already have a Thread Border Router in your home. To add Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth LE, 433 MHz, or Infrared devices, simply connect a [Homey Bridge](https://homey.app/homey-bridge/) to unlock those wireless technologies — no USB sticks required.
